## Array

### 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

type: easy

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example:**

```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

#### Solution

```java
public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2){
		if(l1 == null) return l2;
		if(l2 == null) return l1;
		if(l1.val < l2.val){
			l1.next = mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2);
			return l1;
		} else{
			l2.next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next);
			return l2;
		}
}
```



###  27. Remove Element

type: easy

Given an array *nums* and a value *val*, remove all instances of that value [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

#### Solution

```java
public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
    int m = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
        if(nums[i] != val){
            nums[m] = nums[i];
            m++;
        }
    }
    return m;
}
```



### 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

type: easy

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

#### Solution

    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {  
        int m = nums.length > 0 ? 1 : 0;
        for(int i=1;i<nums.length;i++){
          if(nums[i] != nums[m-1])
          	nums[m++] = nums[i];
        }
        return m;
    }
